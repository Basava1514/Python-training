""" Write a program (function!) that takes a list and returns a new list that contains all the elements
of the first list minus all the duplicates.
For this exercise, we will keep track of when our friendâ€™s birthdays are, and be able to find that
information based on their name. Create a dictionary (in your file) of names and birthdays.
When you run your program it should ask the user to enter a name, and return the birthday of
that person back to them. The interaction should look something like this:
#>>> Welcome to the birthday dictionary. We know the birthdays of:
Albert Einstein
Benjamin Franklin
Ada Lovelace
#>>> Who's birthday do you want to look up?
Benjamin Franklin
#>>> Benjamin Franklin's birthday is 01/17/1706"""
